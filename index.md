{% if site.pilot %}
This course aims to teach a core set of established, intermediate-level software development skills and best practices for working as part of a team in a research environment using Python as an example programming language. It focusses on researchers from the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/) domain as it uses the dataset from the river catchment study project but is general enough to be attended by participants without this specialism.
